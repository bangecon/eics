Description: This function assists covariate selection by helping to identify alternate treatments, 
  intermediate collider variables, and feedback among a treatment and the controls.
  Functions include: 
    eics() to implement "empirically-informed covariate selection" with  random forest to check backdoor
      criteria. 
    altTreat() implements the search for alternate treatments. 
    feedbackVars() checks for feedback between the treatment and the controls. 
    intermediateVars() checks whether the control candidates introduce intermediate bias.
